# Databases Project

Use this repository for your integration code and any source code created while working on your project (ad-hoc code,
SQL queries, project files needed by external tools, etc.).

- Merge your code into the main branch on the due date. 
- Do not commit datasets!
- Any other document (except for the dump in the final hand-in) should be handed-in via ADAM.

If you have any questions regarding the project, please do not hesitate to ask during the exercise lessons or via mail
to [raphael.waltenspuel@unibas.ch](mailto:raphael.waltenspuel@unibas.ch)!

It is recommended that you first create a ```.gitignore``` file. (And exclude the "datasets" folder, for example). A useful tool for creating ```.gitignore``` files is www.gitignore.io.

Feel free to update or replace this readme with a brief description of your project and goals.
